This is a small-scale project created by me, Nghiem Dinh An. My purpose in working on this project was to participate in a competition called the Science and Engineering Fair. The project's name is "Air Quality Tester", and this repository was created to publish a small website that contributes to the overall project. The project was successfully completed, and I won third prize in the competition.
